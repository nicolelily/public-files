# ðŸ“š The Agatha Christie Oeuvre ðŸ“š

## Background
I started out with these datasets intending to participate in [DataFamCon's January 2023 project](https://data.world/datafam-con/january-2023-dame-agatha-christie). 

As I explored, I became more curious about Christie's bibliography and life. I am working on a visualization project about her use of poisons as methods of murder, but along the way I discovered some inconsistencies in the original data I wanted to correct, and some new data I wanted to add.

The four datasets in this project contain all of Agatha Christie's published novels, short stories, and short story collections through 1997. I've provided definitions for each field, so hopefully the data is easy to work with, especially for newer analysts.

If you find any errors or updated data, please create an issue. If you have methodology-relate or other project-related questions, please email me.
